# data-engineer
After one year experience as a Data Analyst, I am kind of confused with my future career roadmap, and made up my mind to break the ceiling by becoming a Data Engineer, This repo is aimed for keeping track of my learning path of Data Engineer.

# Why
I did a research on May 19th 2024 about different kind of data jobs through job search platforms. In comparison, LinkedIn has better filtered data, so I meanly use it for analysis.

There are five factors that really matter to me: opening, remote, high salary (100K+), entry level and visa sponsorship. I assigned different weight to each factor and here is my result: Data Engineer wins with 39 scores in total, standing out for nearly every factor above. Though Data Analyst has the most opening, only a few company sponsor H1B or Green Card, which is similar to Business Analyst. Data Scientist has good salary and visa policy, but not has many entry level jobs. 

In conclusion, Data Engineer is the best choice for me at current stage.
