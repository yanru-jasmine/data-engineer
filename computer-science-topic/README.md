# File I/O
## txt
File I/O is the ability of a program to take a file as input or create a file as output.
### open
automate the opening of a file
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")

file = open("names.txt", "a")
file.write(f"{name}\n")
file.close()
```

### with
automate the closing of a file
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")

with open("names.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(f"{name}\n")
```
## csv
### read
```python
import csv

students = []

with open("students.csv") as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        students.append({"name": row["name"], "home": row["home"]})

for student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student["name"]):
    print(f"{student['name']} is in {student['home']}")
```
### write
```python
import csv

name = input("What's your name? ")
home = input("Where's your home? ")

with open("students.csv", "a") as file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=["name", "home"])
    writer.writerow({"name": name, "home": home})
```

## PIL for image (binary file)
```python
# create animated gif
import sys
from PIL import Image

images = []

# append the second image to the first image
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    image = Image.open(arg)
    images.append(image)

# save the animated gif as costumes.gif
images[0].save(
    "costumes.gif", save_all=True, append_images=[images[1]], duration=200, loop=0

)


```



# Program paradigms
- Imperative ‚Äì code directly controls execution flow and state change
    - procedural ‚Äì organized as procedures that call each other
    - object-oriented ‚Äì organized as objects that contain both data structure and associated behavior
        
- Declarative ‚Äì code declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
    - functional ‚Äì a desired result is declared as the value of a series of function evaluations
    - logic ‚Äì a desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules
    - reactive ‚Äì a desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change

 ## OOP (object-oriented programming)
 ```python
# Classes are a way by which, in object-oriented programming, we can create our own type of data and give them names.
# Convention: Class name is capitalized
# a class is an object or an instance
class Student:

    # Instance Methods:
    # __init__ method in Python is used to initialize objects of a class. It is also called a constructor.
    def __init__(self, name, house, patronus=None):

        # use raise to create exceptions that alerts a potential error created by the user 
        if not name:
            raise ValueError("Missing name")
        self.name = name
        self.house = house
        self.patronus = patronus

    # def __str__(self) provides a means by which a student is returned when called.
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} from {self.house}"

    # Decoractors:
    # use @property above a function to define house as a property of our class
    # by which we can define how attribute of our class (_house) should be set and retrieved
    # Getter for house
    @property
    def house(self):
        return self._house

    # Setter for house
    @house.setter
    def house(self, house):
        if house not in ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]:
            raise ValueError("Invalid house")
        self._house = house        # house is a property, while _house is an attribute  ("_" indicates users should not modify this value directly, should only be set through the house setter)

    def charm(self):
        match self.patronus:
            case "Stag":
                return "üê¥"
            case "Otter":
                return "ü¶¶"
            case "Jack Russell terrier":
                return "üê∂"
            case _:
                return "ü™Ñ"


def main():
    student = get_student()
    print("Expecto Patronum!")
    print(student.charm())


def get_student():
    name = input("Name: ")
    house = input("House: ")
    patronus = input("Patronus: ") or None
    return Student(name, house, patronus)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Class Methods

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, house):
        self.name = name
        self.house = house

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} from {self.house}"

    @classmethod
    def get(cls):
        name = input("Name: ")
        house = input("House: ")
        return cls(name, house)

def main():
    student = Student.get()
    print(student)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Static Methods

## Inheritance
create a class that ‚Äúinherits‚Äù methods, variables, and attributes from another class.
```python
class Wizard:
    def __init__(self, name):
        if not name:
            raise ValueError("Missing name")
        self.name = name

    ...


class Student(Wizard):
    def __init__(self, name, house):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.house = house

    ...


class Professor(Wizard):
    def __init__(self, name, subject):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.subject = subject

    ...


wizard = Wizard("Albus")
student = Student("Harry", "Gryffindor")
professor = Professor("Severus", "Defense Against the Dark Arts")
...
```

## global variables

Utilizing our powers from our experience with object-oriented programming, we can modify our code to use a class instead of a global variable through:
def __init__(self):
        self._balance = 0

```python
balance = 0

def main():
    print("Balance:", balance)
    deposit(100)
    withdraw(50)
    print("Balance:", balance)

def deposit(n):
    global balance
    balance += n

def withdraw(n):
    global balance
    balance -= n

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

# unpacking
## .split()
## index
## total + * for list
```python
def total(galleons, sickles, knuts):
    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts

coins = [100, 50, 25]

print(total(*coins), "Knuts")
```
## total + ** for dictionary
```python
def total(galleons, sickles, knuts):
    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts

coins = {"galleons": 100, "sickles": 50, "knuts": 25}

print(total(**coins), "Knuts")
```
